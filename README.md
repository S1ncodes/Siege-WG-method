üöÄ How to Fix High Ping in Rainbow Six Siege Using WireGuard + VPNJantit

If you're experiencing high ping in Rainbow Six Siege, this project offers a simple solution: route your game traffic through a WireGuard VPN using low-latency servers from VPNJantit
. This can help reduce ping caused by bad ISP routing or regional server issues.

üîß Requirements

WireGuard
 installed (Available for Windows, macOS, Linux)

A free VPN profile from VPNJantit.com

üì• Step-by-Step Setup

Download a Free WireGuard Config from VPNJantit

Visit: https://www.vpnjantit.com/free-vpn

Choose a WireGuard server near your game server region (e.g., Singapore, Germany, US East)

Click "WireGuard" tab and download the .conf file

Import the Config into WireGuard

Open the WireGuard app

Click "Add Tunnel" > "Import from File"

Select the .conf file you downloaded

Activate the VPN Tunnel

Click "Activate" to start the tunnel

Make sure your IP address has changed and the tunnel is stable

Launch Rainbow Six Siege

Start the game and check if your ping is improved

You can check your connected data center from the in-game settings (Settings > General > Display Data Center)

üß† Why This Works

Some ISPs use inefficient or overloaded routing to Ubisoft's servers, especially in regions like Asia, Africa, or Eastern Europe. By using a closer or better-routed WireGuard VPN server, your traffic can reach Siege servers with lower latency and less jitter.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

VPNJantit is free, but servers may get overloaded ‚Äî try different ones to find the lowest ping.

Avoid using VPNs that introduce too much encryption overhead or throttle bandwidth.

This method does not bypass bans or region locks ‚Äî it's purely for improving routing.

Let me know if you'd like to include example configs, scripts to auto-start the VPN with Siege, or advanced routing (e.g. only route Siege traffic through VPN).
